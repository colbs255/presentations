= Java 21

== Intro

- overview
- trying to give you an overview of everything, moving fast

== Sequenced

- new interface
- none of you will leave citadel, but if you happen to find yourself doing another interview, and they ask you to reverse a linked list

== Code snippets

- good developers and you always document your code, so i know you will be excited for this one
- today... gotta do the pre and the code tags
- that's why i left these bullet points here
- when designing an API, examples are one of the best things you can do
- cover fast

== ZGC

- low latency garbage collector with sub ms pause times on TB size heaps
- collect more frequently
- not going to go into how generational garbage collectors work
- when to use and when profile

== Record patterns

- where we get into more functional programming stuff
- contrived example

== Switch

- exhaustive: add or remove
- Method is taking in a generic type and then doing things based on the specific type
- nice side effect
