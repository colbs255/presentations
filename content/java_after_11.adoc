== Garbage Collection (GC)

=== GC Trade-offs

[horizontal]
Throughput:: How much time is spent doing actual application work vs GC work?
Latency:: How does GC affect individual app operations?
Footprint:: How much extra memory is needed for the GC?

=== Java GCs

[horizontal]
Serial:: simple, single threaded
Parallel:: throughput
G1 (default):: balance of throughput and latency
Shenandoah:: latency
ZGC:: latency
Epsilon:: no-op collector
